## Week 3
This week, we focused on accomplishing all MVP features. This includes having a frontend developed and operational, but not designed, two external APIs working, and all DBs talking to each other. Although not impossible, the deadline is achievable.

I've worked on several components this week. The landing page was important to me, so I made it function well with a new authenticated drop down menu and functioning maker/project/reviwer tiles. The tiles were easy, but required a lot of what I call copy paste programming. The reducers and actions were the dullest to work on.

The drop down menu was the easiest since it just uses bootstrap code. The functionality isn't there, but it's only Thursday, so I still have time to work on it.

Working with a team has been pretty challenging. We have to keep everyone up to date on our tasks for the day, remind each other to use the trello board, and more than often remove console logs from other people's projects. The challenging part about working on a team is that you don't know how the product works since you didn't think the entire project through. You know how it works, but following someone elses logic is just a pain in the neck sometimes. Comments are essential.
