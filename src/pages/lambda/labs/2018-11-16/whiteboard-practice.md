## Whiteboard Practice

Lambda assigned me a partner to accomplish a whiteboard interview with another student. It was interesting to say the least.

>Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is an integer from 0 to 9, write a function rotateImage that rotates the image by 90 degrees in the counter-clockwise direction.

GitHub repo for my assigned problem.
