## Week 2 Day 1
This week's theme is integration. We'll need to implement the required APIs need to connect our front end to our back end. We'll also be implementing OAuth using Auth0. Tuesday, we went over what we were able to complete last week on Auth0. We were able to get an API endpoint to hit that redirects you to Auth0 login. We want that process to be done within a modal from the landing page.

We've also revamped the landing page of the site's interface. Nothing major, just a little more represenative of the end product.
